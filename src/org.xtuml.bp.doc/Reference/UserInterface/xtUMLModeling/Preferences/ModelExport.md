Model Export Preferences
========================

## Export OAL

Include (or not) the action bodies' OAL in the export file.  

## Export Graphics 

Include (or not) the canvas graphical data in the export file.  

If a model is exported without graphics, it may still be imported back into 
BridgePoint.  The user will then have to perform the `BridgePoint Utilities > Reconcile Graphics` 
action of the context menu in order to work with the model.  Note that only structural
graphical data can be recreated by the tool.  User graphical layout information
is lost.
